          <p>Hey there! My name is Nick, and I'm a software developer living in Charleston, SC. My family and I just moved here, and we're excited to see what opportunity awaits!</p>

          <p>As a developer, I am interested in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Projects that reward and necessitate creativity</li>
            <li>Working in a collaborative environment that brings out the best in all involved</li>
            <li>Loving what I do!</li>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>I've spent the last several years touring the country as a guitar player for a national country act. I was fortunate enough to see amazing places, play amazing shows, and meet amazing people. Working with different peole in different places every week taught me a great deal about teamwork and resolution. Now, as a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>, I'm able to apply these skills, with my taste for the creative, to a new career in development. As a bonus, I get to have my amazing wife and beautiful 2-year-old daughter by my side as I embark on this newly beachside programming venture!</p>  

          <p>Please reach out for anything you might need. In the meantime, I look forward to working with other great developers to build robust projects, and really just great software!</p>
